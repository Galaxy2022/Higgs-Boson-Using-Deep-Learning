# Higgs-Boson-Using-Deep-Learning

Introduction
In this case study our team designed a Neural Network to replicate the “Searching for Exotic Particles in Highenergy
Physics with Deep Learning” paper architecture using Tensorflow. We trained our model using the
dataset located at the https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HIGGS
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HIGGS) in the UCI Machine Learning Respository. Our objective is to
tune our model to obtain AUC results as close to the result in Table 1.
Technique Low-level High-level Complete
BDT 0.73 (0.01) 0.78 (0.01) 0.81 (0.01)
NN 0.733 (0.007) 0.777 (0.001) 0.816 (0.004)
